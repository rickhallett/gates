TODO: deploy to Zulip bot farm. Leave local instance running for local debugging in the interim.</li>\n<li>Stumbled across the hackathon I found last year; only 7 days of competition time left remaining. There is a chance to win ducats and reputation, so this is now priority 1.</li>\n<li>Set up competition repository to interface with their bot collection, started to familiarise with web crawlers, web scrapers and at least a few hours planning out the idea in concept. It will be, by far, the most complex software I have ever written, should I be able to achieve an MVP version before the deadline. If I can't, but it's still possible longer term, I may indeed be trailblazing into an arena few people could as a single-person team.</li>\n</ul>",

My abilities have increased considerably across multiple new technologies.</li>\n<li>I have failed completely to reserve time for the other things I must learn. Today, I change that.</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Another fairly miserable day. Mood has been low, sour. Full of irritation and contempt. I worked on.</p>\n<p>Accountability: I did not reserve time for the other things I should arguably be learning. My excuse? I spent the first 6 hours of working time wrestling with the deployment of Gates to various cloud providers. AWS is a monster, a moaning bitch of endless configuration. Digital Ocean want $24/mnth for the privilege. A home was found eventually on Heroku.</p>\n<p>My excuse? Sometimes I get hold of a thing and won't let go until its done.</p>\n<p>Some progress was made on Ben's core engine. I will have to work without distraction now if I am to have even a remote chance of something worth submitting to a competition. It is too late to switch now. I would rather submit something that aimed to push the boundary.</p>",
