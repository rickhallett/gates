### Industry Reactions to DeepSeek R1
Reactions from different entities in the industry reveal their
excitement and reservations about the DeepSeek R1 release. Dr. Jim
Fan, a top researcher at NVIDIA, is greatly entertained by the
transparent, open-source nature of the model. Alex Chima demonstrates
his full dedication by setting up a Mac Mini system specifically to
run AGI at home. Twitter user Cash humorously highlights how
DeepSeek's fully open-source model disrupts expectations.

### Running DeepSeek R1 Locally
One of the significant advantages of the DeepSeek R1 release is the
ability to run it on local systems, breaking away from the $200 to
$2,000 per month subscription model. The distilled models can be run
easily on any modern computer, showcasing their incredible versatility
and utility.

### Performance Evaluation
DeepSeek R1 distill's relatively small size does not sacrifice its
significant performance, with scores outmatching GPT-40 and CLA 3.5
Sonet on maths benchmarks. A testament to its capabilities, DeepSeek
R1 offers performance equivalent to OpenAI's 01 model on many
benchmarks. Ethan Mollik, a leading AI professor, reiterates that the
smaller model versions' capabilities match those from Google and
OpenAI.

### Implications for the U.S. and China
DeepSeek R1, a model from China, outperforms U.S. models in similar
benchmarks, prompting discussion of the implications of Chinese labs
opening and trailing U.S. models. Specific iterations also proliferate
on local hardware, possibly changing U.S. strategic control over open
models.

### Potential Market Dynamics
Emerging reactions suggest a potential shake-up of the current market
dynamics. As intelligence becomes cheaper, the market expands and
creates new opportunities. However, there are concerns about
censorship connected to Chinese models, albeit solvable with the
open-source nature of DeepSeek R1, allowing for the removal of such
restrictions.

## Conclusion
The DeepSeek R1 model's release is indeed revolutionary—improving
accessibility to high-performing models, creating new market dynamics,
but also stirring concerns around potential censorship issues.
Open-source ideals look promising for AI's future, allowing us to
anticipate exciting technological advances in the near term.
