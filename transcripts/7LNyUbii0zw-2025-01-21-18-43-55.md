# AI Today: Future Opportunities and Challenges

## Tags
AI, Future technology, Innovation

## Summary
A discussion with Dario Mody, CEO of Anthropics, about the future of
artificial intelligence (AI), and how it's shaping up. The
conversation explores whether AI is hitting a wall, the evolution and
potential of AI, and the commoditization of large language models.

### Current State of AI
Mody discusses his ten-year career in AI, during which he worked at
major companies like Google and Open AI, and his belief that despite
instances where progress seemed to halt, innovations allowed for
continued growth. He firmly declares that AI is not hitting a wall
and, in fact, he's more confident than ever that we are close to
having powerful capabilities.

### Future of AI
Mody expresses the belief that AI could soon outperform humans in
almost all tasks. He suggests the metaphor of a "country of geniuses
in a data center" to describe the potential power and implications of
AI. Over the next few years, Mody forecasts that we might develop AI
systems that can operate on a computer, perform tasks, write and
compile code, communicate with team members, and keep them updated.
The key goal for Anthropics in the next year is building a "virtual
collaborator", and they've begun taking steps towards it with the
development of "computer use" -- a system where AI devices can operate
independently.

### AI and Tech Commoditization
Mody acknowledges the potential for AI to become commoditized, with
enough resources and processing power. However, he believes that only
a limited number of players will have access to the necessary volume
of chips. The unique aspect of each AI model allows for plenty of
differentiation. With Anthropics' Claude model, users have had a more
personable and enjoyable interaction compared to other models on the
market.

### Role in Healthcare
Reference to a study by Stanford Medical School was made, where
radiologists were shown to use models in their diagnoses. The models
were measured both by the accuracy of the diagnoses they provided and
their patient interaction.
    
## Conclusion
AI has come a long way, and the future promises even more
advancements. Although there are concerns about commoditization, given
the demand for massive resources, the unique attributes of each model
implies considerable variations. AI's potential in industries such as
healthcare is also great, but further discussions are needed to
clarify its role.

## Key Questions, Takeaways, etc.
- How far is AI from hitting a "wall" or the limit of its development?
- What are the potent future advantages and threats of AI?
- Is commoditization of AI models possible?
- How can AI be safely integrated into industries such as healthcare?
