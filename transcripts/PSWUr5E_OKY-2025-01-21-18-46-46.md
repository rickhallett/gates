Evaluation, Observability, Mindsets.

## Summary
AI and language models are now influencing the skills required to
excel as an engineer. In the new era of AI engineering, recognizing
and understanding certain skill sets will help individuals stay ahead
of the curve. This document focuses on outlining these skills through
six key sections.

### Index of Sections
1. Working with Models
2. The Art of Prompting
3. Context & Retrieval
4. Orchestration
5. Evaluations and Observability
6. The Mindset for AI Engineering

### Working with Models
The first stop on the roadmap to AI engineering pivots on working
with popular AI models such as OpenAI, Anthropic, Meta, and Google.
Understanding how to work with these models' APIs, manage models
locally or through open-source systems, and operate various models
types is key. However, model training and fine-tuning come later, more
of optimization skills learned once the basics are grasped.

### The Art of Prompting
Prompting plays a vital role in eliciting desired behaviour from a
model. While this sector runs deep, four key strategies have proven
useful: Chain of Thought, Including Examples, Structured Outputs, and
Advanced Prompt Management. Knowledge of these areas opens up job
opportunities such as prompt engineering or leading to advanced
competencies like retrieval.

### Context & Retrieval
This section discusses the concept of retrieval or extracting data to
enrich a language modelâ€™s response (also known as Retrieval-Augmented
Generation or RAG). Important terminologies such as 'embeddings' and
'semantic search' are explored, together with strategies to overcome
retrieval challenges.

### Orchestration
Orchestration involves creating systems that function jointly. The
base level of orchestration makes use of frameworks such as Lang
chain. Once mastered, engineers can delve deeper into the world of
Agents and Long-term Memory, enhancing overall application
performance.

### Evaluations and Observability
Evaluations are considered the unit tests of language model
applications. Evaluations help trace the performance of language
models for more accurate outputs. Observability kicks in by aiding in
tracing, debugging and cost management for AI engineering experiences.

### The Mindset for AI Engineering
Understanding new capabilities that AI brings about, building
swiftly, getting acquainted with emerging tools, scaling AI apps, and
having a growth mindset are vital meta skills for excelling in AI
engineering.

## Conclusion
Entering the era of AI demands the mastery of a new range of skills
and toolsets for engineers. As the industry still grapples with
standardizing best practices, the time is opportune for engineers to
deepen their knowledge, apply these skills and gain a competitive edge
in the industry.
